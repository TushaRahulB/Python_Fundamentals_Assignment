# Python Programming Assignment - Tiger Analytics Internship

This repository contains the solutions I completed as part of the Python programming assignment during my Data Science Internship at **Tiger Analytics**.

The assignment included 27 Python-based questions aimed at testing core programming skills. These problems involved a wide range of topics such as string manipulation, array operations, control flow, input validation, algorithmic logic, pattern generation, and real-world problem simulation.

I solved each question individually and saved them as separate Python files. Iâ€™ve also compiled all solutions into a single Jupyter Notebook for convenience and easier review.

## Contents

- `question1_answer.py` to `question27_answer.py`: Individual Python files for each solution
- `all_question_answers.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all questions and solutions combined

## Topics Covered

- Array and matrix generation
- String manipulation and sorting
- Character and digit counting
- Email and password validation
- Logic-based problems (Armstrong numbers, perfect numbers, binary conversion)
- Pattern-based problems
- Simulation exercises (robot movement, bank transaction logs)
- Combinatorial calculations
- Simple game logic (Stone-Paper-Scissors)
- Health report analysis and comparison

## How to Run

- You can run each `.py` file individually using any Python environment.
- To view and execute all solutions in one place, open `all_question_answers.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or any compatible IDE.

## About

This assignment is part of the evaluation process for my internship at Tiger Analytics. It helped me apply core Python concepts through practical problem-solving.
